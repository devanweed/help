You will eventually be logged out automatically.Rotating your account’s encryption keyDuring a password change operation you also have the option to rotate (change) your account’s encryption key. Rotating the encryption key is a good idea if you believe that your previous master password was compromised or that your Bitwarden vault’s data was stolen from one of your devices.             Warning            Rotating your account’s encryption key is a sensitive operation, which is why it is not a default option. A key rotation involves generating a new, random encryption key for your account and re-encrypting all vault data using this new key.Because your account’s encryption key changes, any old sessions with a Bitwarden application that you may be logged into with your account will still have the old, incorrect encryption key. If you make any changes to your account’s vault data with an old encryption key, that data will become corrupted and unrecoverable. After rotating your account’s encryption key it is very important that you completely log out and back in to all Bitwarden applications where you are using that account. Logging out and back in will ensure that your account has downloaded its new encryption key. We will attempt to log you out of all Bitwarden applications automatically, but it may not happen immediately.        ",

If you are using the public cloud version of Bitwarden, you can skip this step. If you are using a self-hosted deployment of Bitwarden you will want to change the configured environment endpoints of the Directory Connector to your own on-premises installation.  Run the Directory Connector application.  If you are already logged into the application, go to the More tab and Log Out.  On the main log in screen, select the Settings button.  Enter your installation’s base URL and save. For example, https://bitwarden.company.com.Log in to your Bitwarden organization account  Run the Directory Connector application.  Log in with your Bitwarden user account that has Admin or Owner access to your organization.  Go to the Settings tab and select your organization from the Account section.Configure the directory connection  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the Settings tab.  Select the Type of directory server you are configuring from the Directory section.  Set each configuration setting for the directory server type that you selected in step 3. The settings are different for each type of directory. You can read more about setting up each type of directory connection in the following articles:          Active Directory &amp; Other LDAP-based Directories Setup      Azure Active Directory Setup      G Suite (Google) Setup      Okta Setup      Configure sync options  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the Settings tab.  Set each configuration setting from the Sync section. Some settings are dependent on the Type of directory you have configured.             Note            The syntax for user and group filters is different for each type of directory. Learn more about how user and group filters work in the following article:  Configuring user and group sync filters        Test a syncYou can run a sync test in order to check that all of your configuration settings are setup and working as expected. A sync test will query the directory server and print the results to the screen. The results that you see printed to the screen will be what is uploaded and synced to your Bitwarden organization whenever a real sync is performed.  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the Dashboard tab.  Click the Test Now button from the Testing section.Perform a manual sync  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the Dashboard tab.  Click the Sync Now button from the Sync section.Your synced users and groups will be immediately available in your Bitwarden organization. Synced users will receive an email invite to your organization.Sync automatically  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the Dashboard tab.  Click the Start Sync button from the Sync section.The application will begin polling your directory based on the interval you specified in your sync settings. Be sure not to exit/close the application or automatic syncing intervals will stop. You can minimize the application or hide it to the system tray (under the Window application menu).You can click the Stop Sync button to end the automatic syncing intervals.Clear sync cacheAs the Directory Connector works at syncing changes up to your Bitwarden organization it keeps a local cache. This cache helps the Directory Connector only send the difference in directory changes (deltas) from the previous time that it performed a sync operation. If you encounter sync errors or a particular directory change is not correctly being synced, you may need to clear this cache. Clearing the cache will allow a full sync to occur during the next sync operation.  Run the Directory Connector application.  Go to the More tab.  Click the Clear Sync Cache button from the Other section.Command-line InterfaceA command-line interface (CLI) tool is also available to connect to and sync your directory. The Bitwarden Directory Connector CLI is especially useful whenever you are working in environments where a desktop GUI is not available, or if you want to programmatically script directory sync operations using tools provided by the operating system (cron job, scheduled task, etc). The Bitwarden Directory Connector CLI can be used cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions.Quick Start  Download and install the Directory Connector CLI for your platform.  Move bwdc to /usr/local/bin or another directory in your $PATH. Windows users can add bwdc.exe to the current user’s PATH. IMPORTANT: Make sure that the included keytar.node dependency remains in the same directory as the main bwdc executable.      Verify the bwdc command works in your terminal.    bwdc --help  Download and InstallSee the download and install section above for links to download the CLI executable for your platform.             Note            When extracting the zip, make sure that the included keytar.node dependency remains in the same directory as the main bwdc executable.        Shared DataThe Directory Connector CLI shares the same database and configuration settings with the Directory Connector desktop application. You can install and use both applications together, however, you should avoid using them both at the same time.Though not required, often times it may be helpful to use the Directory Connector desktop application first to setup and configure all of your settings before using the Directory Connector CLI.The default location for the shared data.json database file depends on which platform you are using.  Windows : %AppData%\\Bitwarden Directory Connector  macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Bitwarden Directory Connector  Linux: ~/.config/Bitwarden Directory ConnectorThe data-file command can be used to discover the absolute path to the data.json database file on your system.Explore the CLIThe Bitwarden Directory Connector CLI is self-documented with --help content and examples for every command. You should start exploring the Directory Connector CLI by using the global --help option:bwdc --helpThis option will list all available commands that you can use with the Directory Connector CLI.Additionally, you can use the --help option on a specific command to learn more about it:bwdc test --helpbwdc config --helpTest CommandThe test command queries your directory and prints a JSON formatted array of groups and users that will be synced to your Bitwarden organization whenever you run a real sync operation.bwdc testSync CommandThe sync command runs a live sync operation and pushes data to your Bitwarden organization.bwdc syncYour synced users and groups will be immediately available in your Bitwarden organization. Synced users will receive an email invite to your organization.Last Sync CommandThe last-sync command returns an ISO 8601 timestamp of the last time a sync operation has been performed for users or groups:bwdc last-sync usersbwdc last-sync groupsConfig CommandThe config command allow you to specify settings for the Directory Connector CLI to use.bwdc config &lt;setting&gt; &lt;value&gt;For example, if you are using a self hosted Bitwarden server you will need to change the endpoint that the Directory Connector CLI communicates with.bwdc config server https://bitwarden.company.comYou can also use the config command to set parameters that require secure storage and cannot be modified directly in the data.json database file, such as passwords or access tokens.bwdc config ldap.password &lt;password&gt;bwdc config azure.key &lt;key&gt;bwdc config gsuite.key &lt;key&gt;bwdc config okta.token &lt;token&gt;Additional configuration settings can be modified in the Bitwarden Directory Connector desktop application or by editing the data.json database file directly in your favorite text editor. Read more about shared data.             Note            You should avoid opening or modifying the data.json database file while the Directory Connector desktop application or CLI executable is running.

To resolve this you can either:  Tell Android to ignore battery optimization for the Bitwarden app; or  Manually turn on the Bitwarden Auto-fill Service each timeThe auto-fill notification does not appear when I visit a login page in my web browser.This is a currently a known issue with the following browsers, which do not support accessibility services:  Firefox for Android - As a workaround you can use the Bitwarden Firefox addon instead. Navigate to Firefox Settings → Addons and search for “bitwarden”.  Samsung Internet BrowserAndroid has many web browsers. It can be hard to keep up with them all. We have to add support for each browser individually. If auto-fill does not work and your browser is not listed above please report it at https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues so that we can add support.Bitwarden is using a lot of my device's battery power.Unfortunately Android accessibility services can be fairly resource intensive on certain devices.

Depending on the name you give your custom field, Bitwarden will attempt to auto-fill the custom field’s value for you. If you intend to auto-fill custom fields you should name your field based on an identifier from the webpage form. These names are searched for using the following criteria:  HTML form element’s id attribute  then the HTML form element’s name attribute  then the HTML form element’s corresponding label value  then the HTML form element’s aria-label attribute  then the HTML form element’s placeholder attributeIf one of these matches is found, Bitwarden will auto-fill the custom field’s value for you.Special name prefixes for auto-fillingWhen Bitwarden searches a webpage’s form elements to match with your custom field’s name, an exact, case-insensitive comparison is done. For example, if your custom field has the name “PIN”, the following form element’s values (from the id, name, label, etc) will match for auto-filling: “pin”, “PIN”, and “Pin”. However, values such as “pin2” or “mypin” will not match.There are two special name prefixes that can give you even more control over how your custom field is auto-filled:CSVPrefixing your custom field’s name with csv= allows you to specify multiple names to search for and compare when an auto-fill is performed.Example:csv=pin,pin2,mypin will match all of the examples above.Regular ExpressionsPrefixing your custom field’s name with regex= allows you to perform regular expression comparisons when an auto-fill is performed.Example:regex=pin will match all of the examples above.Example:regex=^first.*name will match “firstName”, “First_name”, and “First Name”.",

For example, when adding a new user to an organization you should ask the user to verify their fingerprint phrase via email, over the phone, in person, etc. By verifying the fingerprint phrase with the user outside of Bitwarden you ensure that end-to-end encryption is securely initiated and that the Bitwarden server you are communicating with (and your connection) has not been maliciously tampered with. If you trust the server you are communicating with (and the connection that you are using), you can choose to ignore fingerprint phrase verification.Where do I find my fingerprint phrase?You can find your account’s fingerprint phrase using Bitwarden applications in the following locations:  Web vault: Settings → My Account  Desktop apps: Account → Fingerprint Phrase  Browser extensions: Settings → Account → Fingerprint Phrase  Mobile: Coming soon…  CLI: bw get fingerprint me",

An individual user may wish to further organize the items being shared with them in their own vault into a personalized folder structure that makes sense just for them.        Nested folders (sub-folders)Nested folders work by using a naming convention with the forward slash character (/) as a delimiter. For example, if I have folders with the names “Work” and “Work/Email”, “Email” will be nested as a sub-folder underneath the “Work” folder.Nested folders exampleIn this example I have the following folders:  Personal  Personal/Email  Personal/Email/Sub  Social  Work  Work/Clients  Work/EmailThis would produce a folder structure that looks like this in the web vault (and similarly in other Bitwarden applications):                    There is no limit on the depth that you can go with nested folders, though the application interface may begin to “break” if you go too deep.If a folder’s name contains the forward slash delimiter, yet no “parent” folder exists, its name will be displayed in its entirety. In the example shown above, a folder named “Finance/Banking” would not produce a nested structure. You would need to create a “Finance” folder as well if nesting is desired.",

URIs can relate your login to a website address (URL), server IP address, mobile app package ID, and more. URIs are important values for a login since they determine how the auto-fill functions in Bitwarden will behave.URI schemesA well-formed URI also has a “scheme” at the beginning of it. The most common scheme that many of us are familiar with is the http:// scheme used for a website address.The scheme can also have special meaning in Bitwarden:  http:// or https:// tells Bitwarden that this is a website address. Example: https://www.google.com  androidapp:// tells Bitwarden that this is an android application package ID (or package name). Example: androidapp://com.twitter.android. Android apps typically follow reverse domain name notation.             Note            If a URI omits the scheme, http:// is assumed.        Match detection optionsEach URI for a login item also has an associated “match detection” value. The match detection value determines whether or not Bitwarden will offer the login as an available option when performing an auto-fill.While editing a login you can adjust the match detection value for a given URI by selecting the  Options button next to the URI’s value.The following match detection options are available:             Note            Base domain is the default URI match detection value for all URIs. You can adjust this default value under Settings → Options.        Base domainThe base domain is defined as the second-level domain plus the top-level domain of the given URI. A URI with a value of https://www.google.com would have a base domain value of google.com.Example:  URI base domain value: https://www.google.com  Matches: http://google.com, https://accounts.google.com, https://sub.accounts.google.com, https://accounts.google.com/page.html  Not matches: https://google.net, https://yahoo.comHostThe host is defined as the hostname plus an optional port of the given URI. A URI with a value of https://sub.domain.com:4000 would have a host value of sub.domain.com:4000.Example:  URI host value: https://sub.domain.com:4000  Matches: http://sub.domain.com:4000, http://sub.domain.com:4000/page.html  Not matches: https://domain.com, https://sub.domain.com, https://sub2.domain.com, https://sub.domain.com:5000, http://sub2.sub.domain.com:4000Starts withThe “starts with” option requires that the current website/application URI must start with the value defined in the URI. A URI with a value of https://sub.domain.com/path/page.html?query=123 starts with https://sub.domain.com/path/.Example:  URI starts with value: https://sub.domain.com/path/  Matches: https://sub.domain.com/path/, https://sub.domain.com/path/page.html  Not matches: https://sub.domain.com/path (notice the missing trailing slash), https://sub.domain.com, https://sub.domain.com:4000/path/page.html (has a port)Regular expression             Warning            Regular expressions are an advanced option and can be quite dangerous if used incorrectly. You should not use this option if you do not know exactly what you are doing.        The regular expression option allows you to write any simple or complex regular expression to match the current website/application URI. All regular expressions are case insensitive.Example:  URI regex value: ^https://.*google.com$  Matches: https://google.com, https://sub.google.com, https://sub.sub2.google.com, https://malicious-site.com?q=google.com  Not matches: http://google.com (not https), https://yahoo.comExactThe “exact” option requires that the current website/application URI exactly match the value defined in the URI.Example:  URI exact value: https://www.google.com/page.html  Matches: https://www.google.com/page.html  Not matches: http://www.google.com/page.html (not https), https://www.google.com/page.html?query=123, https://www.google.comNeverA URI with match detection set to “Never” will never be offered for auto-fill.Example:  URI never value: https://www.google.com  Matches: none  Not matches: https://www.google.com, https://google.com, https://sub.google.com/page.html",

The admin portal for your installation is available at https://bitwarden-domain.com/admin.Configuring Admin Portal AccessThe admin portal provides authenticated access to a list of users specified by email address in your installation’s environment file located at ./bwdata/env/global.override.env. For example:adminSettings__admins=john@example.com,bill@gmail.com,tom@example.comThese admin email addresses do not need to be registered with an account on your Bitwarden installation.If you do not want to enable access to the admin portal, you can leave the setting at its default empty value. For example:adminSettings__admins=The admin portal uses a secure means of passwordless authentication. When a user attempts to log into the admin portal a secure link is sent to their email address. The user can click this temporary link to continue logging into the admin portal. The authentication link is active for up to 15 minutes following the log in attempt.

You should open these ports so that Bitwarden can be accessed from within and/or outside of the network. You can choose different ports during installation if you like.If you are serving Bitwarden to the outside world you will need to configure a domain name with DNS records that point to your host machine (ex. bitwarden.company.com). You should configure this domain before beginning your Bitwarden installation.Alternatively, if you are only testing you can install Bitwarden to the “localhost” domain.Install DockerBitwarden will be deployed and run on your machine using an array of Docker containers. Bitwarden will work equally well with Docker Community (free) and Enterprise editions. You should evaluate which edition is best for your installation. Additionally, deployment of these containers is orchestrated through the use of Docker Compose. Docker and Docker Compose must first be installed on your machine before beginning a Bitwarden installation.See the following official Docker documentation for more information:  Install Docker  Install Docker Compose             Note            Some Docker installations such as Windows and macOS already come with Docker Compose installed.        For reference, you can find the official Bitwarden images hosted on Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/u/bitwarden/.Install BitwardenWe’ve made installing Bitwarden very simple. Depending on your environment (non-Windows vs. Windows) we provide Bash (Linux and macOS) and PowerShell (Windows) scripts to aide in installing and managing your Bitwarden installation. The following steps will include references for both Bash and PowerShell.      Download the main Bitwarden script to your machine in the desired location:              Note         All Bitwarden assets will be installed in the ./bwdata directory relative to where the main Bitwarden script resides.           Bash    curl -Lso bitwarden.sh https://go.btwrdn.co/bw-sh \\    &amp;&amp; chmod +x bitwarden.sh     PowerShell    Invoke-RestMethod -OutFile bitwarden.ps1 `    -Uri https://go.btwrdn.co/bw-ps        Start the installer:      Bash    ./bitwarden.sh install     PowerShell    .\\bitwarden.ps1 -install        Complete the prompts in the installer.    Installation Id/Key    Each Bitwarden installation requires a unique installation id and installation key. The installation id and key is used to:          Register your installation and contact email so that we can contact you in case of important security updates.      Validate licensing of paid features.      Authenticate to push relay servers for push notifications to Bitwarden client applications.        You should not share your installation id or installation key across multiple Bitwarden installations. They should be treated as secrets.    You can obtain an installation id and key from https://bitwarden.com/host.    SSL Certificate                  Bitwarden can generate and maintain renewal of a trusted SSL certificate for your domain for completely free provided by Let’s Encrypt and Certbot. Certificate renewal checks occur each time Bitwarden is restarted. Use of the automated Let’s Encrypt certificate requires ports 80 and 443 to be available. Alternatively, you can manage your own Let’s Encrypt certificate outside of the Bitwarden setup script and provide it using the “bring your own SSL certificate” method as described below.            If you already have your own SSL certificate you can place the necessary files in the ./bwdata/ssl/your.domain.com directory. File paths for certificate assets are configurable from the ./bwdata/config.yml file if you wish to change the default paths generated by the installer.                  certificate.crt (required). If not done so already, you may need to bundle your primary certificate with any intermediate certificates provided by the CA or else you will receive SSL trust errors. ex. cat domain.crt ca.crt &gt;&gt; certificate.crt. See here for more information.          private.key (required)          ca.crt (optional, if trusted)          dhparam.pem (optional, if using Diffie Hellman ephemeral parameters). You can create your own dhparam.pem by using OpenSSL with openssl dhparam -out ./dhparam.pem 2048.                            If you are only testing and do not have an SSL certificate, a self-signed certificate can be generated for your installation. Self-signed certificates will not be trusted by Bitwarden client applications so you will need to install this certificate to the trusted store of each device you plan to use Bitwarden with.            If you choose not to configure Bitwarden with a SSL certificate you must front your installation with a proxy that serves the Bitwarden installation over SSL. HTTPS is required to use Bitwarden. If you try to use Bitwarden without the HTTPS protocol you will get errors.      Post-install Environment ConfigurationInstallation Config FileThe Bitwarden setup script uses settings from ./bwdata/config.yml to generate the necessary assets for the installation to operate. More advanced installation scenarios (ex. installations behind a proxy with alternate ports) may need to make further configuration adjustments that were not provided during the standard installation prompts. Additionally, if you need to alter the initial installation settings (ex. changing the domain name used for Bitwarden) these can be made from ./bwdata/config.yml.After changing settings in ./bwdata/config.yml, you can apply them by running:  Bash./bitwarden.sh rebuild PowerShell.\\bitwarden.ps1 -rebuildEnvironment VariablesSome features such as a SMTP mail server settings, YubiKey OTP API credentials, etc. are not configured by the installer. You can find the environment file for these settings (and all others) in the following location: ./bwdata/env/global.override.env. Edit this file and REPLACE the placeholders values for them.Example:globalSettings__yubico__clientId=294620155globalSettings__yubico__key=owdez88RdxVZuGbZ4fvglobalSettings__mail__smtp__host=smtp.sendgrid.netglobalSettings__mail__smtp__port=587globalSettings__mail__smtp__ssl=falseglobalSettings__mail__smtp__username=apikeyglobalSettings__mail__smtp__password=SG.YOUR.API_KEYIf you plan to use YubiKeys for two-step login, you can get your YubiKey client id and key at https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/.Start BitwardenOnce you’ve completed installing and configuring your Bitwarden installation you can start it up:             Note            The first time you start Bitwarden it may take some time as it downloads all of the images from Docker Hub.          Bash./bitwarden.sh start PowerShell.\\bitwarden.ps1 -startYou can then verify that all containers are up and running correctly:docker ps                    Congratulations! Bitwarden is now up and running at https://your.domain.com. Visit the web vault in your web browser to confirm. You should register a new account and log in.Script CommandsThe Bitwarden main script (bitwarden.sh or bitwarden.ps1) has the following commands available:             Note            PowerShell users will run the commands with a prefixed - (switch). For example .\\bitwarden.ps1 -start.                                Command      Description                  install      Start the installer.              start      Start all containers.              restart      Restart all containers (same as start).              stop      Stop all containers.              updatedb      Update/initialize the database.              update      Update all containers and the database.              updateself      Update this main script.              rebuild      Rebuild generated installation assets from config.yml.              Manual Docker InstallationsUsing the provided installation script is the recommended approach for most users, however, you can also install and configure Bitwarden manually using Docker and Docker Compose. A manual installation may be appropriate if you are intimately familiar with Docker technologies and desire more control over your Bitwarden installation. A manual installation follows most of the same steps that the installation script performs for you automatically.             Warning            Manual installations are for advanced users only.Manual installations lose the ability to automatically update certain dependencies of the Bitwarden installation. As you upgrade from one version of Bitwarden to the next you will be responsible for changes to required environment variables, changes to nginx default.conf, changes to docker-compose.yml, etc. We will try to highlight these in the release notes on GitHub. You can also monitor changes to the dependency templates used by the Bitwarden installation script on GitHub.          Download a stubbed version of Bitwarden’s dependencies (docker-stub.zip) from the releases pages on GitHub.  Create a new directory named bwdata and extract the docker-stub.zip archive to it. The directory structure provided matches what the ./docker/docker-compose.yml file’s mapped volumes expect, however, you are free to change the location of these mappings on the host machine if desired.  Get your installation__id and installation__key from https://bitwarden.com/host and provide them to the application’s environment variables at ./env/global.override.env.  Update the baseServiceUri__* and attachment__baseUrl application environment variables for your hostname at ./env/global.override.env.      Generate a .pfx certificate file for the identity container and place it in the mapped volume directory at ./identity/identity.pfx.    Example:    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout identity.key \\  -out identity.crt -subj \"/CN=Bitwarden IdentityServer\" -days 10950openssl pkcs12 -export -out ./identity/identity.pfx -inkey identity.key \\  -in identity.crt -certfile identity.crt -passout pass:IDENTITY_CERT_PASSWORD    Make sure that you provide your IDENTITY_CERT_PASSWORD to the application’s environment variables at ./env/global.override.env.        Copy your SSL certificate and keys to the ./ssl directory. By default, this directory is mapped to the nginx container at /etc/ssl. The ./nginx/default.conf can be adjusted to utilize these certificates as desired.              Note         Accessing the Bitwarden web vault and APIs via HTTPS is required. You should provide a trusted SSL certificate to the nginx container or front the installation with a proxy that provides a HTTPS endpoint to Bitwarden client applications.         Example self-signed certificate:    # mkdir ./ssl/bitwarden.company.comopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 \\  -keyout ./ssl/bitwarden.company.com/private.key \\  -out ./ssl/bitwarden.company.com/certificate.crt \\  -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN \\  -config &lt;(cat /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf &lt;(printf '[SAN]\\nsubjectAltName=DNS:bitwarden.company.com\\nbasicConstraints=CA:true')) \\  -subj \"/C=US/ST=New York/L=New York/O=Company Name/OU=Bitwarden/CN=bitwarden.company.com\"    Update the server_name, HTTPS redirects, and Content-Security-Policy header with your hostname at ./nginx/default.conf.  Generate your own random password strings for the sqlServer__connectionString RANDOM_DATABASE_PASSWORD, internalIdentityKey RANDOM_IDENTITY_KEY, and duo__aKey RANDOM_DUO_AKEY and update the variables at ./env/global.override.env. Also be sure to apply the same RANDOM_DATABASE_PASSWORD at ./env/mssql.override.env  Update the app-id.json file at ./web/app-id.json to include your hostname’s URL (ex. https://bitwarden.company.com).  Configure your SMTP mail server and any other desired application settings at ./env/global.override.env.      Map the desired user and group id for the Bitwarden containers to run under at ./env/uid.env.    Example:    LOCAL_UID=1000LOCAL_GID=1000    Otherwise, you can leave the ./env/uid.env file empty and the containers will run as nobody:nobody.        Start your Bitwarden installation and access it at your configured hostname:    docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up -d  ",

You will need to correct this data by removing it, or reducing its size so that the Bitwarden importer will succeed.You can open the exported file in a text editor or spreadsheet program (such as Excel) to locate it. The offending item can be found at index X (as referenced in the error message) in the file. Once you have located the offending item, remove it or update its data, then resave and try the import operation with Bitwarden again.",

All features that you find in other Bitwarden client applications (desktop, browser extension, etc) are also available through the CLI. The CLI can be used cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions.

Move bw to /usr/local/bin or another directory in your $PATH. Windows users can add bw.exe to the current user’s PATH. If you installed the CLI with NPM (or another package manager) you can skip this step since bw should automatically be added to your path.      Verify the bw command works in your terminal.    bw --help  Download &amp; InstallYou can install the Bitwarden CLI multiple different ways:Native executableNatively packaged versions of the CLI for each platform have no dependencies.   Windows x64   macOS x64   Linux x64NPMIf you already have the Node.js runtime installed on your system, you can install the CLI using NPM. NPM makes it easy to keep your installation updated and should be the preferred installation method if you are already using Node.js.npm install -g @bitwarden/cliOther Package Managers      Chocolatey     choco install bitwarden-cli        Homebrew     brew install bitwarden-cli        Snap     sudo snap install bw  Session ManagementYou can log into your Bitwarden user account by using the login command:bw login [email] [password]After successfully logging into the CLI a session key will be returned. This session key is necessary to perform any commands that require your vault to be unlocked (list, get, edit, etc). You can pass the --raw option to login to receive only the session key from stdout.bw login [email] [password] --rawYou should pass the session key to CLI commands by setting the BW_SESSION environment variable or by using the --session &lt;key&gt; option:Environment Variable  Bashexport BW_SESSION=\"5PBYGU+5yt3RHcCjoeJKx/wByU34vokGRZjXpSH7Ylo8w==\"bw list items PowerShell$env:BW_SESSION=\"5PBYGU+5yt3RHcCjoeJKx/wByU34vokGRZjXpSH7Ylo8w==\"bw list items--session &lt;key&gt; Optionbw list items --session 5PBYGU+5yt3RHcCjoeJKx/wByU34vokGRZjXpSH7Ylo8w==             Note            It is possible to persist your session key to your environment (for example, exporting it in .bashrc), however, we do not recommend doing this. Your active session key is the encryption key used to unlock all data associated with your Bitwarden vault and is not well-suited for persisting on an unprotected disk.        LockingIf you do not pass the session key to commands that require it you will receive an error message that your vault is locked. You can unlock your vault and/or receive a new session key by using the unlock command:bw unlock [password]Additionally, you can manually lock your vault and destroy any active session keys by using the lock command:bw lockIf your active session key is unavailable (for example, you accidentally lost it or closed your active terminal window), your vault is already considered locked and therefore using the lock command is unnecessary.Login != UnlockThe login and unlock commands are different. login requires your email address and master password and performs authentication against the external Bitwarden server (requiring additional two-step login prompts, if configured). unlock performs local authentication only (against a persisted hash) and therefore would work even without an active internet connection or if the external Bitwarden server is not available. You cannot unlock your vault if you have not already logged in first.Most users should prefer locking and unlocking their vault rather than logging out and logging in. This is the same process and workflow that all other Bitwarden client applications follow. A typical use case would be that a user logs into the CLI application only once and then only performs unlock commands thereafter.Explore the CLIThe Bitwarden CLI is self-documented with --help content and examples for every command. You should start exploring the CLI by using the global --help option:bw --helpThis option will list all available commands that you can use with the CLI.Additionally, you can use the --help option on a specific command to learn more about it:bw list --helpbw create --helpManaging Your VaultSyncThe sync command downloads your encrypted vault from the Bitwarden server. If you have changed something in your Bitwarden vault on another client device (for example, the browser extension) you may need to use the sync command before you will see those changes in the CLI:bw syncIt’s important to note that the sync command is only a pull operation. It does not push data to the server since that is already done for you each time you make a change to your vault (create, edit, delete).You can use the --last option to get an ISO 8601 timestamp of the last time a sync has been performed:bw sync --lastListThe list command allows you to retrieve an array of objects from your vault.bw list (items|folders|collections|organizations) [options]You can search the list of returned objects by using the --search option. You can also filter the list by using the --folderid, --collectionid, or --organizationid options. Combining search and filter options performs a logical AND operation.bw list items --search github --folderid 9742101e-68b8-4a07-b5b1-9578b5f88e6fSpecial syntax is available for filters that allows you to specify null and notnull as valid values. Combining multiple filters together performs a logical OR operation.bw list items --folderid null --organizationid notnullGetThe get command allows you to retrieve a single object from your vault.bw get (item|username|password|uri|totp|exposed|attachment|folder|collection|organization|template|fingerprint) &lt;id&gt;You can retrieve an object by its globally using id property (usually a GUID), or you can provide a search term. The search term must be specific enough to only return a single result or the CLI will return an error.bw get item 99ee88d2-6046-4ea7-92c2-acac464b1412bw get password https://google.combw get totp googlebw get exposed yahoo.comIf you are getting an attachment, you must also specify the --itemid &lt;id&gt; option of the item that the attachment belongs to.bw get attachment b857igwl1dzrs2 --output ./photo.jpg \\     --itemid 99ee88d2-6046-4ea7-92c2-acac464b1412bw get attachment photo.jpg --raw \\    --itemid 99ee88d2-6046-4ea7-92c2-acac464b1412CreateThe create command allows you to create new objects in your vault.bw create (item|folder) [encodedJson]The process for creating an object may look something like this:      Get the JSON template(s) for the object you are trying to create:    bw get template folder    Edit the JSON template with the values you want to use for that object.      Base 64 encode the JSON string. You can use the encode command included with the CLI and pipe in the JSON string from stdin:    echo '{\"name\":\"My Folder\"}' | bw encode        Create the item:    bw create folder eyJuYW1lIjoiTXkgRm9sZGVyIn0=  The create command can also receive encoded JSON as stdin. A complete example, using jq to update a template’s JSON (see more about working with JSON below), may look something like this:bw get template folder | jq '.name = \"My Folder\"' | bw encode | bw create folderUpon success, the newly created object will be returned.To create a new attachment for an item, specify the --file path on disk as well as the --itemid.bw create attachment --file ./path/to/myfile.csv \\    --itemid 16b15b89-65b3-4639-ad2a-95052a6d8f66EditThe edit command allows you to edit an item in your vault. It works similarly to the create command with the added requirement of an object id. The edit command will perform a replace operation on the object. Upon success, the updated object will be returned.bw edit (item|item-collections|folder) &lt;id&gt; [encodedJson]bw edit folder dadc91e0-dcda-4bc2-8cd6-52100027c782 eyJuYW1lIjoiV2hhdCBGb2xkZXIifQ==bw get folder dadc91e0-dcda-4bc2-8cd6-52100027c782 | jq '.name = \"Updated Folder\"' | \\    bw encode | bw edit folder dadc91e0-dcda-4bc2-8cd6-52100027c782echo '[\"86544cd3-7e07-42bb-ba3c-e7f59852acaa\",\"ae8c6c9e-26de-442c-b63b-3e28ef61d72d\"]' | \\    bw edit item-collections db71c8d6-3e69-4593-a6de-505e94966290DeleteThe delete command allows you to delete an object from your vault.bw delete (item|attachment|folder) &lt;id&gt; [options]bw delete folder dadc91e0-dcda-4bc2-8cd6-52100027c782bw delete attachment b857igwl1d --itemid 310d5ffd-e9a2-4451-af87-ea054dce0f78ShareThe share command allows you to transfer an item from your personal vault to an organization’s vault for sharing.

The CLI will not automatically update. You must download new versions of the CLI manually.bw updateA URL to download a new version of the CLI executable will be returned to you.             Note            If you have installed the CLI through a package managers (such as NPM), you should use the update commands available for that tool. For example, npm install -g @bitwarden/cli will update you to the latest version of the CLI on NPM.        VersionThe --version option allows you to check which version the CLI you are currently using.bw --versionWorking with JSONCommands in the CLI will either return a JSON string or a simple string such as a URL, GUID, or message. When you need to parse or manipulate JSON input/output with the CLI we recommend using the jq command-line tool.# Get a login item's passwordbw get item google | jq '.login.password'# Create a new folder from a templatebw get template folder | jq '.name = \"My Folder\"' | bw encode | bw create folder# Update an existing folder's namebw get folder dadc91e0-dcda-4bc2-8cd6-52100027c782 | jq '.name = \"Updated Folder\"' | \\    bw encode | bw edit folder dadc91e0-dcda-4bc2-8cd6-52100027c782Source CodeAs with everything here at Bitwarden, the CLI is fully open source and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bitwarden/cli.AppendixTemplatesYou can use the get command to retrieve templates for various types of request objects and sub-objects. Templates are useful when needing to get the “base” JSON object to work with while using the create command. A template’s JSON properties are sometimes populated with example data that you should change.  item  item.field  item.login  item.login.uri  item.card  item.identity  item.securenote  folder  collection  item-collectionsbw get template itemSome templates are meant to be used as sub-objects to another template’s properties.

This “website icons” feature allows you to easily identify particular logins in your vault by a recognizable icon. This is usually represented by a logo or brand image of that website. The Bitwarden icons server provides the delivery endpoint for these website icons.If you are using the “website icons” feature on a device, Bitwarden will issue requests to icons.bitwarden.net for each item of type “Login” in your vault that has a URI that resembles a website (ex. google.com or https://google.com, but not google or http://localhost). The icons server is fronted with a CDN that caches the icons on Cloudflare’s edge nodes all around the world. Subsequent requests to the same icon will likely hit CDN caches instead of the icons server directly. Your requests may never actually hit Bitwarden’s icons server because another Bitwarden user with the same website in their vault requested the icon before you.Privacy concernsBecause a request for an icon image contains the hostname of the website stored in your vault, it is important to understand that this feature will “leak” otherwise cryptographically protected information to Bitwarden servers and/or CDN endpoints. An example of a icon request looks like the following:https://icons.bitwarden.net/google.com/icon.pngThe icons server endpoints do not log or collect any information regarding icon image requests. However, this is something you would have to take our word for since we have no way to demonstrate this publicly other than reviewing our open source codebase.Disabling website iconsWe understand that certain privacy-minded users may not want to use the “website icons” feature. We provide the option to disable website icons on all Bitwarden client applications:  Web vault: Settings → Options → Disable Website Icons  Browser extension: Settings → Options → Disable Website Icons  Mobile app: Settings → Options → Disable Website Icons  Desktop app: Settings → Options → Disable Website IconsWhen the website icons feature is disabled, Bitwarden will opt to show you a generic, locally accessed icon instead () that is the same for all login items stored in your vault.",

          "content": "Collections allow you to group related items that are being shared from your organization’s vault. A simple personal organization for a family may only want to have one or two collections (ex. Parents and Kids), while a larger organization like a company may have many collections (ex. Servers, Social Media Accounts, Executives, etc).                    When you add a new user to your organization, you can associate that user to one or more collections within your organization. Once the user has access to your organization, any items that are placed into that user’s associated collections will be available in their vault. When associating a user to a particular collection, you can also decide whether or not that user has write access to logins contained within it. Selecting the Read Only option will ensure that the user cannot add, edit, or delete any items within that particular collection (they can just view and use them). You can also associate user groups to collections in the same way.             Note            Collections are different than folders. Collections are a way to organize items and control user access within an organization’s vault while folders are a way for individual users to organize items within their own personal vault. An individual user may wish to further organize the items being shared with them in their own vault into a personalized folder structure that makes sense just for them.        Nested collections (sub-collections)Nested collections work by using a naming convention with the forward slash character (/) as a delimiter. For example, if I have collections with the names “Servers” and “Servers/Production”, “Production” will be nested as a sub-collection underneath the “Servers” collection.             Note            Creating sub-collections is only for display purposes. Collection access and permissions are not inherited by their “child” sub-collections.        There is no limit on the depth that you can go with nested collections, though the application interface may begin to “break” if you go too deep.If a collection’s name contains the forward slash delimiter, yet no “parent” collection exists (or the user does not have access to the parent collection), its name will be displayed in its entirety.             Note            Nested-collections work similarly to nested folders. You can refer to the Folders article for more information on creating nested structures in your vault.        ",

User AssignmentAfter creating a user, you can assign that user to one or more groups.

Users can be removed from the group from this page as well, however, adding a new user to a group must be done from the individual user.                    Collection AssignmentAccess control for a group is done by assigning collections to a group (or vice versa). You can assign which collections a group can access by editing the group from the group listing page.                    Alternatively, edit a collection from the collections listing page to choose which groups can access it.Organization users will only be able to access items that belong to the groups (and therefore collections) that they are members of.

You can use the API to manage your organization’s members, collections, groups, event logs, and more. The API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.             Note            API access is only available to enterprise organizations.        Table of Contents  Endpoints  Content Types  Authentication  Errors  Explore the APIEndpointsThe following endpoints are used when accessing the API:Public Cloud Server API  Authentication: https://identity.bitwarden.com/connect/token  Base URL: https://api.bitwarden.comOn-premises Server API  Authentication: https://your.server.com/identity/connect/token  Base URL: https://your.server.com/apiContent TypesThe Bitwarden RESTful API communicates with application/json requests and responses. The only exception is the authentication endpoint, which expects a application/x-www-form-urlencoded request. The authentication endpoint will respond with application/json.AuthenticationThe Bitwarden RESTful API uses bearer access tokens to authenticate with protected API endpoints. An OAuth2 client credentials (application) flow is used to obtain a bearer access token from the authentication endpoint. You can obtain your client_id and client_secret from your organization through the web vault. Navigate to your organization’s administrative area, then Settings → My Organization → API Key.             Note            Your API Key (specifically the client_secret) should be kept private. If you believe that this key has been compromised, you can always invalidate and rotate the key from the organization’s administrative area.        To obtain a bearer access token, make a application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST request with your client_id and client_secret to the authentication endpoint. For access to the organization APIs, you will use the api.organization scope.Example request:curl -X POST \\  https://identity.bitwarden.com/connect/token \\  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&amp;scope=api.organization&amp;client_id=&lt;ID&gt;&amp;client_secret=&lt;SECRET&gt;'A bearer access token with a expiration value (in seconds, from now) will be returned.Example response:{  \"access_token\": \"&lt;TOKEN&gt;\",  \"expires_in\": 3600,  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"}You can then use this bearer token in the Authorization header to make authorized calls to API endpoints.Example:curl -X GET \\  https://api.bitwarden.com/public/collections \\  -H 'Authorization: Bearer &lt;TOKEN&gt;'You will need to keep track of the token’s expiration and renew it whenever it nears expiration or has expired. Calling API endpoints that require authorization without a bearer token or with an expired token will return a 401 Unauthorized status code.ErrorsThe Bitwarden RESTful API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided. Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Bitwarden’s servers (these are rare).  200 - OK: Everything worked as expected.  400 - Bad Request: The request was unacceptable, often due to missing or malformed parameter.  401 - Unauthorized: No valid bearer token provided.  404 - Not Found: The requested resource doesn’t exist.  429 - Too Many Requests: Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.  500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors: Something went wrong on Bitwarden’s end. (These are rare.)Explore the APIThe Bitwarden RESTful API is compatible with the OpenAPI specification and publishes a compliant swagger.json definition file.You can explore and execute the API endpoints and their definitions using Swagger UI at:Public Cloud Server API  https://docs.bitwarden.com/api/On-premises Server API  https://your.domain.com/api/docs/",

Whereas an organization is used for sharing items across multiple users, a premium membership gives your individual user account additional premium features (called premium access). Some of these features may also exist within an organization (ex. file storage and TOTP), however, they only apply to items that are actually store/shared within the organization itself. If you also want premium access on your personal user account you will additionally need a premium membership for that account.Some organization plans, such as the Enterprise plan, also grant premium access to its users. The Families organization plan can also grant premium access to its users by purchasing the optional Premium Access Addon.
